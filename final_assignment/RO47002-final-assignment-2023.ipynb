    "## Introduction\n",
    "We are in the year 2023. Tech companies are striving to develop robotic helpers to help people with their day to day tasks. Your employer is working on a new feature for their robots. The feature aims at enabling their robots to go outside and collect deliveries for their owners. The deliveries would be dropped off at designated locations in front of a person's home. The robots should be able to navigate safely towards the delivered parcels, taking care not to enter the road. They should also be able to operate at any given time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the upcoming demo to their stakeholders, your employer would like to showcase the robot going along the sidewalk to collect a red parcel. The demo is to take place within a blocked off part of the sidewalk in front of your workplace. Safety cones have been propped up next to the sidewalk in order to have a safety bound between the sidewalk and the road. The robot needs to remain on the sidewalk and go to the parcel at the end of the sidewalk. To prepare for the demo, your employer has booked three timeslots with the robot throughout the week. These timeslots ('Time 0', 'Time 1', and 'Time 2') are at different times of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are just starting out as a robot AI engineer, you first get the familiarization assignment to train a model solely for opperating at 'Time 1' before moving on to designing a more general AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Robot AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, the robot's actions need to be determined based on only the robot's last observation (i.e. sensor measurements). More technically: the goal is to create a function $policy(observation) \\rightarrow action$, which the robot can continuously apply in a loop on its sensor measurements to determine its next action. This type of function is often called a *policy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the input and output of the policy function `policy` are defined as:\n",
    "- the input `observation` will be an RGB image (a numpy array) containing a view of the robot's surroundings.\n",
    "- the output `action` should be an integer out of one of the possible actions (an integer between 0 and 2):\n",
    "\n",
    "    0. Turn left\n",
    "    1. Turn right\n",
    "    2. Move forward\n",
    "\n",
    "[comment]:<> (More details will be provided later in the section 0. Code to get you started\" below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the policy function will completely determine the behavior of the robot.\n",
    "You can think of the robot executing the policy in a never-ending loop (in pseudo-code):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Pseudo robot main loop with policy f\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    observation = read_sensor_measurement()\n",
    "    action = policy(observation) # apply the policy\n",
    "    execute_action(action)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In fact, the behavior is already implemented for you in a **simulator**. This means you can test a policy function `policy` by plugging it in the simulator and seeing how your robot behaves!\n",
    "The simulator also allows us to quantify how well your robot behaved by returning a 'reward' value for each simulation step (a higher reward is better). More details on the rewards will be explained below in Section 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task description: imitation learning\n",
    "\n",
    "These type of tasks, where a robot's policy needs to be optimized to achieve a high expected reward for operating in some environment, is often addressed through *reinforcement learning*. However, in this assignment we will *not* use reinforcement learning techniques, but mainly treat the problem as a **supervised classification task**.\n",
    "The training input (observations) and output (action labels) data will be obtained through demonstrations of humans *manually* controlling the robot. By training your machine learning models on these demonstrations, you will create an AI which \"imitates\" how a human would control the robot. This type of supervised machine learning is therefore called *imitation learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some coding challenges and design choices that you have to solve to use human demonstrations as labeled data to create your machine learning models. As before, you will have to think about feature extraction, hyperparemeter optimization, evaluation metrics, comparing models, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have trained a classification model, you could define a new policy function which uses your trained model, and test this policy in the simulator. Does your most successful model also accumulate the most reward in the simulation? Can you make an AI which successfully operates at recorded and unrecorded times of the day?"

This includes all used data/demonstrations (including the ones that were provided), any loadable parameter files, any auxiliary scripts, etc.\n",

    "* Make sure that the notebook runs correctly. That is, clear all outputs, restart the kernel and run the notebook from top to bottom. \n",
    "* The notebook needs to be able to run within 20 minutes on a high-end PC, performing all steps (also including training, the only exception is hyperparameter optimization which can be commented out).\n",

    " - Choose figures/plots/tables carefully. Only include those that add to the story of the report. Do not put the burden on the reviewer to figure out which results you are basing your conclusions on, but specifically refer (parts of) the specific table/plot/figure when needed.\n",
    " - When comparing two or more signals display them in one plot. Explain the colors / line types. The scale of the plots must be carefully chosen in order to clearly convey the information intended. Label the axes in graphs properly (variables and units).\n",
